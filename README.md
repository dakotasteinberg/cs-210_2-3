SNHU CS-210 "What's Bugging You" assignment. Final submission.

The purpose of this assignment was to successfully identify and
fix any bug in an already existing program. Other changes included
the addition of an if statement and the modification of the formatting
of the program's code and output for better readability. See below for
further info on the process I used when completing this assignment.

How I fixed/modified the following program:
I first started with all the issues underlined in
red by my IDE. This allowed me to fix many syntax
errors in the program. I then ran the program and
saw no output. I was able to fix the while loop
and then received output on the terminal. After
doing this, I went back and forth between fixing
logic errors and running the program, making few
changes between each run of the program. Once all
logic errors had been resolved, I created the
requested if statement to allow users to input N or n
to quit the program and receive the "Program Finished."
message. Finally, having fixed all errors and
adding all requested functionality, I made some
modifications to the code and output statements to
"beautify" the program on both sides so that the
code AND the program's output are easier to read.
